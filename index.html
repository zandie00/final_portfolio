            <h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h3>
            <p>
                We would like to express our gratitude to Ma'am Jamila Macapundag, our instructor in Professional Education 7-Technology for Teaching and Learning 1, for her advice, kindness, and unwavering support during the completion of this e-portfolio, "The Journey of Matter: Beyond the Matter – My Learning Journey."

Her teachings taught us a better understanding of how technology may be implemented to teach science in a meaningful way, particularly when introducing concepts of matter to students in Grade 3. Through her encouragement and clear instructions, we were able to create educational activities and resources that align with the Grade 3 Science competencies on classifying solids, liquids, and gases based on observable qualities thanks to her support and clear directions.

We are truly thankful for her dedication in helping us grow as future educators. Her guidance inspired us to be creative, reflective, and responsible in developing teaching materials that support interactive and effective learning.

Furthermore, we would like to acknowledge our group  for the insights and assistance, which significantly improved the content and structure of this portfolio.

            <h3>DEDICATION</h3>
            <p>
                This e-portfolio is dedicated to future Grade 3 learners and future educators who will explore the topic of matter. May this serve as a helpful learning resource that makes understanding solids, liquids, and gases simple, engaging, and meaningful.

We also dedicate this e-portfolio to future educators who will guide young learners in their learning journey. May this serve as a source of ideas and inspiration in using creative strategies and technology to teach science effectively. May it remind them that teaching is not only about lessons, but also about helping learners grow with curiosity, confidence, and love for learning.

                This e-Portfolio taught me patience and flexibility in lesson planning.
                I learned how different activities can help learners better understand
                concepts such as solids, liquids, and gases. It motivated me to become
                a more understanding and supportive teacher.

                For our e-Portfolio, I wrote the objectives and helped make digital worksheets and reflections. My group and I created fun activities for Grade 3 Science, Quarter 1, about Matter, with pictures, materials, and simple instructions so students can understand solids, liquids, and gases easily. 
                
                We made sure everything was right for their grade level and easy to follow. I also got to practice working with my group, designing things digitally, and citing sources properly. Doing this project really helped me improve my planning, creativity, teamwork, and digital skills. 
                
                This project taught me a lot about planning lessons, working with others, and using digital tools, and I feel more prepared and excited to teach my future students.

                Creating an e-portfolio is not easy as I think  I have to put enough time, effort and patience into it but even though it's not that easy  Creating this e-portfolio  helped me develop important skills related to Science. 
                
                This experience changed how I view learning in Science. I now understand that learning about matter is not just about memorising facts, but about developing inquiry skills, critical thinking, and the ability to apply concepts to real-world situations. My e-portfolio represents my effort, progress, and growth as a future educator. It clearly shows how my understanding of matter has developed over time. 
                
                Creating this e-portfolio  will be valuable for my future students because it provides a clear model. I can use it to show students examples of investigations, reflections, and explanations related to matter. It will also help me design lessons that focus not only on content knowledge but also on inquiry, reflection, and understanding. By sharing parts of my e-portfolio, I can encourage students to reflect on their own learning and see mistakes as opportunities for improvement. 
                
                Reflecting on my learning was one of the most challenging but meaningful parts of the e-portfolio. Science often focuses on results, but reflection encouraged me to think about the processes behind those results. Creating this e-portfolio will make a crucial contribution not just for but also for all learners who are willing to learn.

            <p>
                My journey in making an e-portfolio was challenging. At the beginning, I felt unsure because I did not know how to start.  I was worried about what to include and how to design it. I realized that building an e-portfolio was not simply about collecting artifacts. Designing the e-portfolio also challenging choosing a platform and experimenting with layouts required me to balance structure with creativity.

                This process taught me the importance of presentation. How we organize and display our work can greatly influence how others perceive it. I learned to think critically about design choices, The act of designing became an exercise in creativity, allowing me to merge technical skills with artistic expression.
                Reflection was perhaps the most transformative part of the journey. Reflection turned the e-portfolio into more than a showcase it became a mirror of my identity. 

                This project reinforced the importance of thoughtful planning. The idea of compiling my work into a digital portfolio felt overwhelming

                Working on this project enhanced my appreciation for student-centered learning.
                I learned that effective teaching requires creativity, empathy, and adaptability.
                This experience inspired me to continuously improve my teaching strategies.
