            <p>
                We would like to express our gratitude to Ma'am Jamila Macapundag, our instructor in Professional Education 7-Technology for Teaching and Learning 1, for her advice, kindness, and unwavering support during the completion of this e-portfolio, "The Journey of Matter: Beyond the Matter – My Learning Journey."

Her teachings taught us a better understanding of how technology may be implemented to teach science in a meaningful way, particularly when introducing concepts of matter to students in Grade 3. Through her encouragement and clear instructions, we were able to create educational activities and resources that align with the Grade 3 Science competencies on classifying solids, liquids, and gases based on observable qualities thanks to her support and clear directions.

We are truly thankful for her dedication in helping us grow as future educators. Her guidance inspired us to be creative, reflective, and responsible in developing teaching materials that support interactive and effective learning.

Furthermore, we would like to acknowledge our group  for the insights and assistance, which significantly improved the content and structure of this portfolio.

            <h3>DEDICATION</h3>
            <p>
                This e-portfolio is dedicated to future Grade 3 learners and future educators who will explore the topic of matter. May this serve as a helpful learning resource that makes understanding solids, liquids, and gases simple, engaging, and meaningful.

We also dedicate this e-portfolio to future educators who will guide young learners in their learning journey. May this serve as a source of ideas and inspiration in using creative strategies and technology to teach science effectively. May it remind them that teaching is not only about lessons, but also about helping learners grow with curiosity, confidence, and love for learning.

                This e-Portfolio taught me patience and flexibility in lesson planning. Through compiling digital worksheets, presentations, videos, and documents, I learned that using this approach can help students better understand the concepts of solid, liquid, and gas. Each activity requires proper planning to ensure that it is appropriate, engaging, and aligned with the lesson objectives.

                Organizing materials and presenting them in a digital format also helped improve my technical skills and creativity. I realized that an effective lesson is not only about providing content to learn, but also about how the content is presented and accessed by learners.

                Designing the e-Portfolio challenged me to think from the learners’ perspective and consider how different learning styles can be supported through visual, interactive, and reflective materials. This experience inspired me to become a more proactive, adaptable, understanding, and supportive teacher. It strengthened my commitment to continuous learning and innovation in teaching.

                For our e-Portfolio, I wrote the objectives and helped make digital worksheets and reflections. My group and I created fun activities for Grade 3 Science, Quarter 1, about Matter, with pictures, materials, and simple instructions so students can understand solids, liquids, and gases easily. 
                
                We made sure everything was right for their grade level and easy to follow. I also got to practice working with my group, designing things digitally, and citing sources properly. Doing this project really helped me improve my planning, creativity, teamwork, and digital skills. 
                
                This project taught me a lot about planning lessons, working with others, and using digital tools, and I feel more prepared and excited to teach my future students.

                Creating an e-portfolio is not easy as I think  I have to put enough time, effort and patience into it but even though it's not that easy  Creating this e-portfolio  helped me develop important skills related to Science. 
                
                This experience changed how I view learning in Science. I now understand that learning about matter is not just about memorising facts, but about developing inquiry skills, critical thinking, and the ability to apply concepts to real-world situations. My e-portfolio represents my effort, progress, and growth as a future educator. It clearly shows how my understanding of matter has developed over time. 
                
                Creating this e-portfolio  will be valuable for my future students because it provides a clear model. I can use it to show students examples of investigations, reflections, and explanations related to matter. It will also help me design lessons that focus not only on content knowledge but also on inquiry, reflection, and understanding. By sharing parts of my e-portfolio, I can encourage students to reflect on their own learning and see mistakes as opportunities for improvement. 
                
                Reflecting on my learning was one of the most challenging but meaningful parts of the e-portfolio. Science often focuses on results, but reflection encouraged me to think about the processes behind those results. Creating this e-portfolio will make a crucial contribution not just for but also for all learners who are willing to learn.

            <h3>MARRIEL CANARIA</h3>
            <p>
                Creating e-Portfolio for Grade 3 Science, specifically focusing on the topic of Matter, has been both a challenging and transformative experience. At the outset, I felt uncertain and overwhelmed. I did not know how to begin, what to include, or how to design the portfolio in a way that would truly reflect my teaching philosophy and instructional strategies. Initially, I thought an e-Portfolio was simply a collection of artifacts lesson plans, activities, and instructional materials. However, as I progressed, I realized that it is much more than that. It is a purposeful and creative representation of my identity as an educator, a mirror of my growth, and a tool for reflection.

One of the first challenges I encountered was deciding on the platform and layout. With so many digital tools available, I struggled to choose one that would balance structure with creativity. Experimenting with different layouts taught me that presentation matters greatly. The way we organize and display our work influences how others perceive it. A well-designed portfolio can communicate clarity, professionalism, and creativity, while a poorly organized one may diminish the value of even the most thoughtful content. This realization pushed me to think critically about design choices, ensuring that my portfolio was not only functional but also visually engaging.

The process of designing became an exercise in creativity. I had to merge technical skills with artistic expression, experimenting with colors, fonts, and layouts that would make the portfolio appealing without distracting from the content. This balance was not easy to achieve, but it allowed me to see how creativity and structure can coexist in educational work. It reminded me that teaching itself requires this balance lessons must be structured enough to meet learning objectives, yet flexible and creative enough to engage students meaningfully.

Reflection was perhaps the most transformative part of this journey. As I compiled my teaching artifacts, I began to see patterns in my instructional style. I noticed how I consistently tried to integrate interactive and student-centered activities, such as group work, visual aids, and hands-on experiments. Reflection turned the portfolio into more than a showcase of materials; it became a mirror of my identity as an educator. I realized that my teaching is not just about delivering content but about fostering curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking in my students. This insight deepened my appreciation for the role of reflection in professional growth. It is through reflection that we connect our philosophy with our practice, identify areas for improvement, and celebrate our strengths.

The project also reinforced the importance of thoughtful planning. At first, the idea of compiling my work into a digital portfolio felt overwhelming. However, breaking the process into smaller steps selecting artifacts, designing layouts, writing reflections helped me manage the task more effectively. This experience reminded me that planning is essential not only in creating portfolios but also in teaching. A well-planned lesson ensures that learning objectives are met, while thoughtful planning in professional tasks ensures clarity and coherence.

Ultimately, this e-Portfolio journey has been a meaningful learning experience. It challenged me to step out of my comfort zone, to think critically about design and presentation, and to reflect deeply on my teaching practices. More than just a compilation of materials, the portfolio became a representation of my growth, creativity, and identity as an educator. It taught me that teaching is not only about knowledge delivery but also about how we present, reflect, and continuously improve. Moving forward, I see our group e-Portfolio not as a finished product but as a living document one that will evolve as I continue to grow in my profession and inspire my students to explore, question, and learn with curiosity and joy.

            <p>
                Creating an e-portfolio helped me understand the importance of organizing and presenting our learning in a meaningful way. At the beginning, we  had to decide what content best represented. This process made me reflect on the work I am most proud of and how each piece shows progress over time. Collecting artifacts such as projects, assignments, and videos that help us to organize our e-portfolio 

                Another important part of creating the e-portfolio was learning how to design it in a clear and professional way. We focused on the content of our work, layout, navigation, and consistency so that anyone viewing it could easily understand our work. Writing reflections for each section helped me explain not just what I did, but what I learned from each experience. This improved my ability to think critically about my learning and communicate it clearly.
